📡 AI Drift Radar
A full-stack data drift, model degradation & MLOps assistant powered by Streamlit + Groq Llama 3.1.

🚀 Overview
AI Drift Radar helps ML teams detect data drift, diagnose model degradation, evaluate metrics, compute embedding shift, trigger retraining decisions, and generate detailed reports.
It also includes a multi-agent AI assistant for contextual explanations.
